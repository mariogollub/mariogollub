- 👋 Hi, I’m @mariogollub
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, math, science and I am a big fan of programmers, coding for us on twitch or Youtube (Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero, Ryan Ries' Zelda-like game, OLC aka One Lone Coder, and many more). In the last decade, I was modding Morrowind, Skyrim, DaggerfallUnity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently more into learning C/C++.
- I like to work in Bash, C-Shell, C, C++, CommonGatewayInterface, CSS, ECMA, HTML, Javascript, MySQL, Perl, Posix Shell, Python. I am not a big fan of Frameworks, they hide the beauty of the world. My times with asm, C64-BASIC, DOS, TurboPascal, BorlandPascal and JAVA were long gone. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on low-level stuff.
- 📫 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am also a real person.
